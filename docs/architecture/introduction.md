# Introduction

## Intro Content

This document outlines the overall project architecture for 用户收货地址管理, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

本项目是一个现有的棕地项目，我们正在对其进行增强。因此，我们没有使用新的启动模板。所有的架构设计将基于对现有代码库的分析和理解。
